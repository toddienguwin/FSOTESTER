FSO |  ATTEMPT 4  |  09.2022 

Why so many attempts? Well the first three attempts  were just aimlessly? is that how i use that word. You have to know what i mean. I didnt get past the first part because setting up react was just 'hard' (i was lazy).

Anyways, this attempts seems promising. My previous project involves express, mongoose, ejs, and a whole lot of hours of just manually inputting data. I probably could of done it faster with pythoon but  thats for another time. 
Anyways, Since learning state and useEffect, I can already see how I can apply it to the previouis project I just mentioned. This is completely new to me..., but in hindsight its probably because I've never actually developed a whole project myself before.
Anyways, I hope this goes well. 

Lastly, just to remind myself. KISS.

Sincerely,

Tod Nguyen
